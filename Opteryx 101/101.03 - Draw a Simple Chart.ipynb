In this session, Lab 101.03, you'll build on the skills developed in Lab 101.02. By the end of this lab, you will know how to integrate Opteryx results with Matplotlib to create visual representations of your data.\n","\n","**What You Will Learn and Do:**\n","\n","- Learn to prepare and execute a SQL query to retrieve data suitable for visualization.\n","- Feed your Opteryx query results into Matplotlib, a popular plotting library.\n","- Create and customize a pie chart to visually represent the data from your query.\n","\n","For this lab, weâ€™ll use a dataset detailing Space Missions from 1957 to 2022, made available by Mysar Ahmad Bhat on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/space-missions/versions/1?resource=download). This dataset was published on 2022-08-10 under a Public Domain license.\n","\n","**Getting Started**\n","\n","Ensure that your Python environment is set up as you did in Lab 101.01.\n","\n","**Take Off!**\n","\n","It's time to take your SQL skills to the stars?
